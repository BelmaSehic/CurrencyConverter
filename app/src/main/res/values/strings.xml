Many currencies of the world are traded by businesses,
        individuals, and even nations. As of this writing,
        the top six most popular currencies for trading are:

U.S. dollar (USD)
Euro (EUR)
Japanese yen (JPY)
Great British pound sterling (GBP)
Australian dollar (AUD)
Canadian dollar (CDN)
In some cases, foreign currencies are used by other countries.
        For example, Chinese exports may be priced in USD instead of
        Renminbi (RMB), which translates to “the people’s currency.”
        The U.S. dollar is the most commonly used and traded currency,
        even if it isn’t technically the strongest currency of the world.

        An exchange rate refers to the value of one currency in relation to another—for example,
        how many Mexican pesos are equal to one U.S. dollar.

        You can also think of an exchange rate as showing how much of one currency
        can be bought by one unit of another. These rates are important for
        people making international money transfers or planning overseas travel.

Your trip may be more or less expensive in your home currency, depending on how strong it is compared to the currency of your destination.
