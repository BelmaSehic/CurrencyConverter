# Currency Converter
![Logo](file:///C:/Users/Korisnik/Downloads/My%20project-1.png)
This is a simple Currency Converter made in Android Studio using Jetpack Compose. The project was for University purposes and therefore is not using API connection but a RoomDatabase. Although most of these projects have only one screen - the converting one, a few more activities have been inserted. The converted values are saved in the database and displayed on the "View history" screen. Also, the "View current rates" screen gives the user the possibility to see a list of current exchange rates and to read something in general about currencies, just so that the application is not empty. The project was made to meet the deadline and might be updated.
